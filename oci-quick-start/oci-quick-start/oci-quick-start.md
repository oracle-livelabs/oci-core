# Create Compute instance, Block Volume and install an app.

## Introduction

In this lab we will create a compute instance, install httpd server, attach block volume to it, and install an app on the Block Volume. We will then create a second compute instance using the boot volume of the first compute instance and move the Block Volume to the second compute instance (with the app installed).

## Objectives
- Demonstrate launching VCN
- Compute Instance
- Use Boot volume of compute instance
- Move additional storage with applications/tools installed between compute instances.

## Task 1: Create VCN

1. From the OCI Services menu, click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under **Networking**. Select the compartment assigned to you from drop down menu on left part of the screen
2. Click **Start VCN Wizard**.

   **NOTE:** Ensure the correct Compartment is selected under COMPARTMENT list.

      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      ssh -i SSH-KEY-NAME opc@PUBLIC-IP-OF-COMPUTE-1
      </copy>
      ```

      Ex: ssh -i id_rsa opc@193.122.146.136

      *Note: If a "Permission denied error" is seen, ensure you are using '-i' in the ssh command. Also make sure that you correctly copied the name of your ssh key and the public IP of your compute instance.*

11. Enter 'Yes' when asked 'Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?'.

12. Verify opc@`<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_NAME>` appears on the prompt.

  Ex: [opc@quickstart_instance ~]

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
      </copy>
      ```
      (Open port 80 on the firewall to allow http and https traffic).

      *NOTE: Despite the line wrapping, the --add-port flag has no spaces.*
      ```
      <copy>
      sudo firewall-cmd --reload
      </copy>
      ```
      (Reload the firewall to activate the rules).

      lsblk
      </copy>
      ```

     ![](./images/Quick_S4P4.PNG " ")

      **HINT:** The name of the block volume storage will start with 'sd'. In this case it is sdb, but could change for your specific attachment (i.e sdc, sda). In the above example this volume is called sdb, shown by its 50GB volume (the size of the compute instance created in Step 2).

5. To format the block volume, Enter Command:


      ```
      <copy>
      bash            
      sudo fdisk /dev/VOLUME_NAME -l
      </copy>
      ```
      *NOTE: VOLUME_NAME should be replaced by the string starting with 'sd' that you identified as the block volume storage in part 4.*

      **For example: sudo fdisk /dev/sdb -l**   
      Wait for formatting to complete

6. Create a file system on the block volume, Enter Command:    

      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      sudo mkfs.ext4 -L datapartition /dev/VOLUME_NAME
      </copy>
      ```  
      *NOTE: VOLUME_NAME should be replaced by the string starting with 'sd' that you identified as the block volume storage in part 4.*

      This will create the file system on the entire disk. Enter **y** when prompted with **Proceed anyway (y/n)?**. (For this lab we will not be creating additional partitions.)


      ![](./images/Quick_S4P6.PNG " ")
      
      *NOTE: The above screenshot shows parts 6 & 7.*

      </copy>         
      ```

8. Mount the disk to the newly created directory. Enter command:

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo mount  /dev/VOLUME_NAME  /mnt/www/html
      </copy>
      ```
      *NOTE: VOLUME_NAME should be replaced by the string starting with 'sd' that you identified as the block volume storage in part 4.*

      ![](./images/Quick_S4P8.PNG " ")

      *NOTE: The above screenshot shows parts 8 & 9.*

9. Verify /dev/`<VOLUME_NAME>` volume is now mounted to /mnt/www/html directory, Enter command:

      ```
      <copy>
      lsblk
      </copy>
      ```
      (in this case the volume is called sdc)

     ![](./images/Customer_Lab_006.PNG " ")

10. Next we will download an app and install it. Enter command:

      ```
      <copy>
      cd /home/opc
      </copy>
      ```
      
      ![](./images/Quick_S4P10.PNG " ")
      
      *NOTE: The above screenshot shows parts 10 & 11.*

11. Enter Command:

20. Open a new tab and enter **http://PUBLIC-IP** where PUBLIC-IP is the IP address of the compute instance from STEP 2 and a screen like below should appear.

     ![](./images/Customer_Lab_008.PNG " ")

We have initialized httpd.conf file. Next we will create a second compute instance using the boot volume of the first compute instance and attach Block Volume to it

## Task 5:(OPTIONAL): Detach the block volume and launch second compute instance using boot volume and attach Block Volume

In this section we will detach the block volume, Stop the compute instance, use its boot volume to launch a second compute instance and delete the second compute instance.

1. In ssh session to the compute instance unmount the directory from block volume, Enter command:

      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      sudo umount /dev/VOLUME_NAME
      </copy>
      ```

      ![](./images/Quick_S5P1.PNG " ")

2. In OCI console window, Click your compute instance name and in **Attached Block Volume** section  Click the action icon and **Click Detach**. Then, verify the detachment by pressing **Continue Detachment** and **OK** in the Confirm Window.

      ![](./images/Quick_S5P2.4.PNG " ")

3. Stop your compute instance by Clicking **Stop** in compute instance details page. Then, click **Stop Instance** in the Confirm window.

4. Once the instance is in Stopped state, Click **Boot Volume**, Click action icon and Click **Detach**. Click **Detatch Boot Volume** in Confirm window.


5. Once the Boot volume is detached, Click **Terminate** to Terminate the instance. Then, click **Terminate Instance** in the Confirm window.

6. Click the action icon, Click **View Boot Volume Details**.

      ![](./images/Quick_S5P6.PNG " ")

7. In the Boot Volume Details window Click **Create Instance:**

8. Repeat the settings detailed in **STEP 2** to create an instance.

9. Wait for the instance to be in Running state. Then, use the instructions from **STEP 3** to attach the block volume and ssh to compute instance.

  *NOTE: Ensure to use Paravirtualized mode and wait for the block volume to change from 'Attaching' to 'Attached'.*

10. To compute instance and mount the block volume as before, Enter Command:
  *NOTE: <VOLUME_NAME> should be replaced by the string starting with 'sd' that you identified as the block volume storage in the previous step. *
      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      sudo mount  /dev/DEVICE_PATH  /mnt/www/html
      </copy>
      ```
      
      ![](./images/Quick_S5P10-11.PNG " ")

*NOTE: This screenshot shows steps 10 & 11.*


11. To restart httpd, Enter command

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo systemctl restart httpd
      </copy>
      ```

12. Launch a web browser and Enter compute Instance's public IP, **`http://<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>`**

13. Screen like below should appear, Enter the required information.

     ![](./images/Customer_Lab_015.PNG " ")

We have now successfully launched a compute instance using another instance's boot volume and re-attached a block volume that was attached to another instance. The block volume preserved all the data on it during this process. Moreover the compute instance launched using the boot volume had httpd server and fire wall configuration already present.

## Task 6: Delete the resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window.

2. If your Compute instance is not displayed, From OCI services menu Click **Instances** under **Compute**.

3. Locate the compute instance, Click Action icon and then **Terminate**.

4. Make sure Permanently delete the attached Boot Volume is checked, Click Terminate Instance. Wait for instance to fully Terminate.


5. From OCI services menu Click **Block Volumes** under Block Storage.

6. Find the storage block volume you created.

   **HINT:** If multiple storage block volumes are listed, scroll down to find the one you created.   

7. Click the Action icon and select **Terminate**.

8. Click OK in the confirmation window.

9. From OCI services menu Click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking, list of all VCNs will
appear.

10. Locate your VCN , Click Action icon and then **Terminate**. Click **Delete All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted.
