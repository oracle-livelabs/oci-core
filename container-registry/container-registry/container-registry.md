# Create Docker registry in OCI

## Introduction

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry is an Oracle-managed registry that enables you to simplify your development to production workflow. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry makes it easy for you as a developer to store, share, and manage development artifacts like Docker images. And the highly available and scalable architecture of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ensures you can reliably deploy your applications.

## Task 1: Sign in to OCI Console and create VCN, Auth token and Docker Registry

1. Sign in using your tenant name, user name and password. Use the login option under **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**.

2. From the OCI Services menu, click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking. Select the compartment assigned to you from the drop down menu on the left part of the screen under Networking and Click **Start VCN Wizard**.

    **NOTE:** Ensure the correct Compartment is selected under COMPARTMENT list

3. Click **VCN with Internet Connectivity** and click **Start VCN Wizard**

4. Fill out the dialog box:

    - **VCN NAME**: Provide a name
    - **COMPARTMENT**: Ensure your compartment is selected
    - **VCN CIDR BLOCK**: Provide a CIDR block (10.0.0.0/16)
    - **PUBLIC SUBNET CIDR BLOCK**: Provide a CIDR block (10.0.1.0/24)
    - **PRIVATE SUBNET CIDR BLOCK**: Provide a CIDR block (10.0.2.0/24)
    - Click **Next**

5. Verify all the information and  Click **Create**

6. This will create a VCN with following components.

    *VCN, Public subnet, Private subnet, Internet gateway (IG), NAT gateway (NAT), Service gateway (SG)*

7. Click **View Virtual Cloud Network** to display your VCN details.

    *We will now create an Auth Token. This token will be used to login to connect to OCI Docker registry from the Docker compute instance that will be created later on*

8. In OCI console Click the user icon (top right)  then **User settings**. Under Resources Click **Auth Token**, then **Generate Token**. In pop up window provide a description then Click **Generate Token**

     ![](./../autonomous-data-warehouse/images/ADW_006.PNG " ")

9.  Click **Copy** and save the token in Notepad. **Do not close the window without saving the token as it can not be retrieved later**

     ![](./../container-registry/images/AUTHTOKEN.PNG " ")

10. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Developer Services**, and select **Container Registry**.

11. Click **Create Repository**. Provide Repository name (all Lowercase), Check **Public** for **Access**, Click **Create Repository**

12.  Once created, verify there are no existing images in the repository



*We now have a Docker registry and Auth token (to validate login to the registry). Next we will use Cloud Shell to test pushing and pulling images from the registry.*

## Task 2: Create compute instance install Docker and push images to registry

1. From the OCI Console, click on the **cloud shell** icon as shown below. This should launch a cloud shell session for the user.

    ![](./../container-registry/images/1.png " ")

    *NOTE: Ensure the correct Compartment is selected under COMPARTMENT list*

2. We will now pull a example image from Docker registry  to the compute instance. Enter Command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker image pull alpine
    </copy>
    ```
    Verify image pull was successful, Enter Command
    ```
    <copy>
    docker images
    </copy>
    ```
    and verify alpine is present

     ![](./../container-registry/images/OCIR_HOL0037.PNG " ")

3. Now we will push this image to Docker registry created in OCI. First login to Registry in OCI. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    bash
    docker login <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io
    </copy>
    ```

    **NOTE:** Region name code are, fra for Frankfurt, iad for Ashburn, lhr for London, phx for Phoenix.

    **HINT:** Your region is shown on top right corner of OCI console window

4. Provide the information:

    - Username:  Enter it in format Tenancy Name/User name (for example: TS-SPL-55/john_doe)
    - Password: Paste the Auth key saved earlier (Characters wont be visible)

     ![](./../container-registry/images/OCIR_HOL0038.PNG " ")

5. Verify Login Succeeded message is displayed.

6. Next we will tag the image that we pulled from the web. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker images
    </copy>
    ```
    and note down the image id of alpine. Enter command: (No Spaces)

    ```
    <copy>
    bash
    docker tag <image_id>  <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io/<TenancyName>/<docker_registry_name>:<image_name>
    </copy>
    ```

7. Verify the tag was created, Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker images
    </copy>
    ```
    and verify version<x.y>.test is present.

    **NOTE:** In below example (version4.0.test) x is 4 and y is 0

      - Image\_Id is **3fd9065eaf02**
      - Region\_Name\_Code is **iad**
      - Tenancy\_Name is **us\_training**
      - docker\_registry\_name is **docker-test-image**
      - Image\_name is **version4.0.test**  

     ![](./../container-registry/images/OCIR_HOL0039.PNG " ")

8. We will now push the image to docker registry in OCI. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker push <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io/<Tenancy_Name>/<docker_registry_name>:<image_name>* (No Spaces)
    </copy>
    ```
    **NOTE:** In below example:

     - Region\_Name\_Code is **iad**
     - Tenancy\_Name is **us\_training**
     - docker\_registry\_name is **docker-test-image**
     - Image\_name is **version4.0.test**  

     ![](./../container-registry/images/OCIR_HOL0040.PNG " ")

9. Switch to OCI window and navigate to your registry. Newly pushed image should be visible.

    **HINT:** Refresh the browser window if image is not displayed

10. Switch to compute instance ssh window. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker pull <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io/<Tenancy_Name>/<docker_registry_name>:<image_name>*  (No Spaces)  
    </copy>  
    ```

11. Verify the pull command was successful

     ![](./../container-registry/images/OCIR_HOL0041.PNG " ")

    **HINT:** We are pulling the same image that we just pushed.

*We now have a working Docker registry and can successfully push and pull images to/from it.*

## Task 3: Delete the resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window

2. From OCI services menu Click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking, list of all VCNs will
appear.

3. Locate your VCN , Click Action icon and then **Terminate**. Click **Terminate All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted

     ![](./../container-registry/images/CUSTOM_IMAGE_0013.PNG " ")

4. Navigate to your registry (**Container Registry** under **Developer Services**), Click Registry Name, Under **Actions** Click **Delete Repository**, Click **Delete** in confirmation window.
