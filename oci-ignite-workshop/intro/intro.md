The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Certification provides candidates with foundational knowledge of core cloud computing concepts and an understanding of those services in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The certification is intended for candidates with technical and non-technical backgrounds who want to validate their understanding of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

The labs featured on this page cover various solutions, skill levels, and categories based on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

## About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is a set of complementary cloud services that enable you to build and run a wide range of applications and services in a highly available hosted environment. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offers high-performance compute capabilities (as physical hardware instances) and storage capacity in a flexible overlay virtual network that is securely accessible from your on-premises network.

## About Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud

Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud regions are logically and physically separate from the existing Oracle commercial cloud regions in the European Union (EU). Both private companies and public sector organizations can use Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud regions to host data and applications that are sensitive, regulated, or of strategic regional importance.

The isolation of the Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud realm from the commercial public cloud realm allows Oracle to restrict support and operations personnel to EU residents, including physical and logical access to the realm. The hardware and assets used to provide these cloud regions are owned, operated, and managed by EU legal entities that are separate from the existing global Oracle entities, including those in the EU. This design provides added assurance that all aspects of managing and hosting data in the Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud stays within the EU.
