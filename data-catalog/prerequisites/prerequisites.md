  15. Click **Download**.
      The wallet file gets downloaded as a zip file and is named **Wallet_&lt;databasename&gt;.zip**.

## Task 5: Prepare the Autonomous Data Warehouse

In this workshop, **Autonomous Data Warehouse** serves as the **target data asset** for our data catalog tasks. In this step, you will configure your target Autonomous Data Warehouse database in order to complete all the labs in this workshop.

In this task, you create a new user on the Autonomous Data Warehouse and then run an SQL script to create the database objects that you need for the data catalog tasks.

1. From the Console navigation menu, select **Oracle Database**, and under **Autonomous Database**, click **Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

  ![Select ADW menu](./images/oci-menu-adw.png " ")

2. On the **Autonomous Database** page, ensure that you are in the compartment that you have created for the **data-catalog-livelab-work** data catalog resources, and click the autonomous data warehouse that you created, that is **Data Catalog Workshop**.

  ![Select ADW](./images/select-adw.png " ")


3. In the **Tools** tab, in the **Database Actions** section, click **Open Database Actions**.

  ![Database Actions](./images/open-db-actions.png " ")

4. On the Database Actions Sign in page, enter your username and password, and click **Sign in**.

  ![admin page](./images/admin-user-pass.png " ")

5. In the **Database Actions** page that appears, in the **Development** section, click **SQL**.

  ![SQL](./images/sql-tile.png " ")

6. In the SQL worksheet that opens, create a new user named **sales_history**. To create the user copy the following code, paste it in the worksheet, and then run it:

    ```
    <copy>CREATE USER sales_history IDENTIFIED BY "password";
    GRANT CREATE table TO sales_history;
    GRANT CREATE view TO sales_history;
    GRANT CREATE type TO sales_history;
    GRANT CREATE session to sales_history;
    GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO sales_history;
    GRANT CREATE sequence TO sales_history;
    GRANT CREATE procedure to sales_history;
    GRANT CREATE trigger to sales_history;</copy>
    ```

     > **NOTE:** Ensure that you enter a password in place of password. Also, make sure that the script output shows the success of the commands.

  ![Create User](./images/create-user-sql.png " ")

7. **Download** the zip file [DCAT Workshop files.zip](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/Ei1_2QRw4M8tQpk59Qhao2JCvEivSAX8MGB9R6PfHZlqNkpkAcnVg4V3-GyTs1_t/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/oci-library/DCAT%20Workshop%20files.zip) to your local directories. Unzip this file.

8. In the same SQL worksheet, run the **DCAT\_Livelabs.sql** script from the unzipped archive from the previous step, to create the rest of the database objects that you need for the following labs.

   The SQL script creates tables CHANNELS, COSTS, COUNTRIES, CUSTOMERS, PRODUCTS, PROMOTIONS, SALES, and SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS and TIMES, which will serve as the target tables for the data catalog operations.

   ![Create tables](./images/adw-run-sql-script.png " ")

9. Refresh the browser and in the Navigator on the left, switch to the `sales_history` schema to verify that your tables were created successfully. If still your new user does not appear, kindly log out and login again.

  ![Sales History Schema](./images/sales-history-schema.png " ")


You may now **proceed to the next lab**
