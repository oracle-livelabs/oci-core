# Configure Virtual Cloud Network Peering

## Introduction

Local VCN peering is the process of connecting two VCNs in the same region and tenancy, so that their resources can communicate using private IP addresses without routing the traffic over the Internet or through your on-premises network. Without peering, a given VCN would need an Internet gateway and public IP addresses for instances that need to communicate with another VCN.

Estimated Time: 50 minutes

### Objectives
- Create two virtual cloud networks
- Create two compute instances in different VCNs
- Configure Route Tables and Security Lists to establish local peering connection between two VCNs
- Verify the peering connection

### Prerequisites
* An Oracle Cloud Account - please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported
* SSH keys created in Oracle Cloud Shell

    - Source CIDR: **172.16.0.0/24**
    - IP Protocol: **ICMP**

    ![Add Ingress Rule for the First VCN](images/ingress-rule1.png " ")

15. Click **Add Ingress Rules**.

16. Repeat Step 10 - 12 for the second VCN's Route Table. Navigate to the second VCN's Details page and click **Route Tables**, then **Default Route Table for `<SECOND_VCN_NAME>`**. 
    
    Click **Add Route Rules** and add the following rule:
    
    **Second VCN Route Table:**

    - Target Type: **Local Peering Gateway**
    - Destination CIDR Block: **10.0.0.0/24**
    - Compartment:  Make sure the correct Compartment is selected
    - Target Local Peering Gateway: Select the Local Peering Gateway of the second VCN
    
    Click **Add Route Rules**.

    ![Add Local Peering Gateway Route Rule for the Second VCN](images/route-rule2.png " ")

17. Repeart Step 13 - 15 for the second VCN's Security List. Navigate to you VCN details page. Click **Security Lists**, then **Default Security List for `<SECOND_VCN_NAME>`**. 
    
    Click **Add Ingress Rules**. Enter the following Ingress Rule. Ensure to leave **Stateless** flag un-checked.

    **Second VCN Security List Rule:**
    - Source CIDR: **10.0.0.0/24**
    - IP Protocol: **ICMP**
    
    Click **Add Ingress Rules**.
    
    ![Configure Security List for the Second VCN](images/ingress-rule2.png " ")

**We now have two VCNs with one compute instance in each VCN. These VCNs have been connected using a Local Peering Gateway. Any instance in one VCN can reach any instance in the other VCN. Next we will test the connectivity.**

## Task 3: SSH to compute instance and test VCN Peering

1. Using Cloud Shell, enter the following command:

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ~/.ssh/
    </copy>
    ```

2. Enter **ls** and verify that your ssh file exists.

3. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    ssh -i <sshkeyname> opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_FIRST_COMPUTE>
    </copy>
    ```

    **We will SSH to the first compute instance**.

    >**Note:** User name is opc. This will enable port forwarding on local host.

    **HINT:** If *Permission denied error* is seen, ensure you are using '-i' in the ssh command.

4. Enter **yes** when prompted for security message.

5. Verify opc@`<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_NAME>` appears on the prompt.

    ![SSH to the First Compute Instance](images/ssh.png " ")

6. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    ping <PRIVATE_IP_OF_SECOND_COMPUTE_INSTANCE>
    </copy>
    ```

    >**Note:** Use Private IP of the compute instance that you are not connected to.

    **Verify the ping is successful.**
    ![Verify Peering is Successful](images/peering-success.png " ")

    If ping is successful, then we have successfully created VCN peering across two different VCNs.

## Task 4: Delete the resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window.

2. If your compute instances are not displayed, from OCI services menu, click **Instances** under **Compute**.

    ![Click Instances](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/compute-instances.png)

3. Locate your compute instances. Click Action icon and then **Terminate**.

    ![Terminate Your Compute Instance](images/terminate-instance.png " ")

4. Make sure **Permanently delete the attached boot volume** is checked. Click **Terminate instance**. Wait for the instance to be fully terminated.

    ![Permanently Delete the Attached Boot Volume](images/delete-boot-volume.png " ")

5. Repeat Step 3 - 4 to delete the second compute instance.

6. From OCI services menu, click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under **Networking**. A list of all VCNs will appear.

    ![Click Virtual Cloud Networks](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/networking-vcn.png)

7. Locate your VCN. Click Action icon and then **Terminate**. Click **Delete All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted.

    ![Terminate Your VCN](images/terminate-vcn.png " ")
