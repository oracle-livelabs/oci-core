# Cost Analysis

## Introduction
Cost Analysis tools are visualization options which can be accessed by the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, they provide useful trend lines which help detect patterns in usage right away, patterns which can be looked at over various services in OCI. It gives functionality in terms of filtering, so you can access data in which you are most interested in. To be able to use the Cost Analysis you must be a member of the Administrator group.

A cost report is a comma-separated value (CSV) file that is similar to a usage report, but also includes cost columns. The report can be used to obtain a breakdown of your invoice line items at resource-level granularity. As a result, you can optimize your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure spending, and make more informed cloud spending decisions.
A usage report is a comma-separated value (CSV) file that can be used to get a detailed breakdown of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for audit or invoice reconciliation.
