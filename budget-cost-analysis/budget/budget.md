# Budget Creation

## Introduction

Budget: You can use budgets to set soft limits on your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure spending, and you can also set alerts on your budget too, to let you know when you might exceed your budget. You can view all your budgets and your current spending from a single place in OCI console. So, let’s get started

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes

### Prerequisites

2. Enter relevant  **Description** in description field.

## Task 4: Select Budget Scope
1. For budgets targeting a compartment select a target compartment for your budget from the **Target Compartment** drop-down list.
2. For budgets targeting a **Tag**:
    - Select a tag namespace
    - Select a target tag key.
    - Enter a value for the tag.
3. For budgets targeting a child tenancy select a target tenancy for your budget from the **Target Tenancy** drop-down list.

3. In this workshop we have selected **Budget Scope** as Compartment.

  *Note: While the budget tracks spending in the specified target compartment, but you need to have permissions to manage budgets in the root compartment of the tenancy to create and use budgets.*

## Task 5: Select the Target for your budget
1. Select The compartment that you want to create the budget for, from the Target Compartment drop-down list. 
2. The root compartment has been selected for this workshop, you can choose the compartment you want or have been assigned to set budget.

## Task 6: Set monthly amount and schedule for you budget
1. Choose between a monthly recurring or custom non recurring budget schedule. For this lab, choose **Monthly** option.
2. Enter a monthly amount for your budget in the **Monthly Budget Amount** field. The minimum allowed value for your monthly budget is   1; the maximum allowed value is 999,999,999,999.
3. From **Day of the month to begin budget processing**, select the day of the month that you want budget processing to periodically begin on each month. Setting this value allows you to create a budget that aligns with your billing cycle date, and to receive more meaningful budget alerts.

## Task 7: Configure your alert rule
1. Alerts are optional but that’s a feature lets you specify the threshold on which you want an alert to be created and triggered a mail with a customized email body.

2. Alerts are evaluated in every 15 minutes and can be triggered under two conditions the first is when actual spend in OCI hits that threshold and secondly when your forecasted spent hit that threshold.

3. Select a threshold for your alert from the **Threshold Metric** drop-down list. There are two possible values:

   **Actual Spend** will watch the actual amount you spend in your compartment per month, In this workshop we have selected Actual spend.

   **Forecast Spend** will watch your resource usage and alert you when it appears that you'll exceed your budget. The forecast algorithm is linear extrapolation and requires at least 3 days of consumption to trigger.

4. The Label of the next text field changes depending on what type of threshold you selected. Enter either a **Threshold %** or a **Threshold Amount**. In this workshop we have selected Percentage of Budget, but you can select Actual spend also.

2. Enter the body of your email alert in the **Email Message** field. The text of the email message cannot exceed 1000 characters.
