### OCI Cost Analysis

Cost Analysis is an easy-to-use visualization tool to help you track and optimize your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure spending, allows you to generate charts, and download accurate, reliable tabular reports of aggregated cost data on your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure consumption. Use the tool for spot checks of spending trends and for generating reports. Common scenarios you might be interested in include:

* Show monthly costs for compartment X and its children, grouped by service or by tag.
* Show daily costs for tag key A and tag key B, values X, Y and Z, grouped by service and product description (SKU).
* Show hourly costs for service = compute or database, grouped by compartment name.
