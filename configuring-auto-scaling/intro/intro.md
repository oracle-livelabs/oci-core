# Introduction

Get hands-on learning with training labs about Oracle cloud solutions. The workshops featured cover various solutions, skill levels, and categories based on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Autoscaling

Autoscaling lets you automatically adjust the number of Compute instances in an instance pool. This helps you provide consistent performance for your end users during periods of high demand, and helps you reduce your costs during periods of low demand.

You can apply the following types of autoscaling to an instance pool:

* **Metric-based autoscaling**: An autoscaling action is triggered when a performance metric meets or exceeds a threshold.
* **Schedule-based autoscaling**: Autoscaling events take place at the specific times that you schedule.
