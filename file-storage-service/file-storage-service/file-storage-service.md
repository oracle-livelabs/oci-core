# File System Storage Service

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud Storage (File System Storage) self-paced lab from Oracle!

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) File Storage Service provides a durable, scalable, distributed, enterprise-grade network file system. You can connect to a File Storage Service file system from any bare metal, virtual machine, or container instance in your Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). You can also access a file system from outside the VCN using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect and Internet Protocol security (IPSec) virtual private network (VPN).

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Create and mount File Storage System to a compute instance
- Verify availability of the File Storage system

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- Completed all preceding labs

	![](images/file-s2p4.png " ")
	![](images/file-s2p4.5.png " ")

We now have a File System Storage created. Next we will use your SSH key pair to connect to a compute instance and mount the file system.

## Task 3: Create and Connect to Compute Instance

You are assumed to have generated your SSH Keys in the *Cloud Shell*.

1. In your OCI console, click the navigation button. Under **Compute**, click **Instances**.
    ![](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/compute-instances.png " ")

2. On the left sidebar, select the **Compartment** in which you placed your VCN under **List Scope**. Click **Create Instance**.
   	![](images/quickstart-s2p2.png " ")

    Fill out the dialog box:

     - **Name**: Enter a name
     - **Create in Compartment**: Select the compartment in which you placed your VCN
     - Under **Placement**, Select an **Availability domain**

    ![](images/file-s3p3.png " ")

    For **Image and Shape**, click **Edit**: 
     - For the **image**, we recommend using the latest *Oracle Linux* available. Click **Change Image** to see available images' details.

    Click **Change Shape**:
     - **Instance Type**: Select **Virtual machine**
     - **Shape series**: Select a VM shape

    ![](images/quickstart-s2p4.png " ")

    Under **Networking**:
     - **Virtual cloud network Compartment**: Choose the compartment in which you created your VCN
     - **Virtual cloud network**: Choose the VCN you created in Task 1
     - **Subnet Compartment:** Choose the compartment in which you created your VCN
     - **Subnet:** Choose the Public Subnet (Public Subnet-Name\_of\_VCN) under **Public Subnets**
     - **Public IP address**: check **Assign a public IPv4 address**
     - **Use network security groups to control traffic** : Leave un-checked
    
    ![](images/configure-networking.png " ")

      - **Add SSH keys:** Choose **Paste public keys** and paste the public key you created and saved in Lab 1
      - **Boot volume:** Leave the default

    ![](images/quickstart-s2p6.png " ")

3. Click **Create**.

    > **Note:** If 'Service limit' error is displayed, choose a different shape from VM.Standard2.1, VM.Standard.E2.1, VM.Standard1.1, VM.Standard.B1.1, or choose a different Availability Domain.

4.  Wait for instance to be in **Running** state. Go to the directory where you created you SSH Keys.

   For example, in Cloud Shell, enter command:
    ```
	<copy>cd .ssh</copy>
	```

5.  Enter **ls** to verify your SSH key file exists.

6.  Enter command
    ```
    <copy>bash</copy>
    ```

    ```
    ssh -i <SSH_Key_Name> opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE>
    ```

    *Hint: If 'Permission denied error' is seen, ensure you are using '-i' in the ssh command. You MUST type the command, do NOT copy and paste ssh command.*

7.  Enter 'yes' when prompted for security message.

     ![](images/connect-instance.png " ")

8.  Verify opc@COMPUTE\_INSTANCE\_NAME appears on the prompt.

## Task 4: Mount the File System Storage to Compute Instance

Users of Ubuntu and Linux operating systems (we launched a Oracle Linux instance) can use the command line to connect to a file system and write files. Mount targets serve as file system network access points. After your mount target is assigned an IP address, you can use it to mount the file system. You need to install an NFS client and create a mount point. When you mount the file system, the mount point effectively represents the root directory of the File Storage system, allowing you to write files to the file system from the instance.

1. Click the navigation button, click **Storage**, under **File Storage**, click **File Systems**. Click your File System. Under **Exports**, click the mount target name under **Mount Target**. Click Action icon on the right, and select **Mount Commands**. Execute the three commands in Mount Commands in your Cloud shell / Terminal. *If you finish this part, you can skip step 2-4 in this Task.*

    ![](images/fss-006.png " ")
    ![](images/mount-commands.png " ")  
2. After you ssh to your compute instance, enter command:

    ```
    <copy>sudo yum install nfs-utils</copy>
    ```
    (This is just to ensure nfs-utils is installed)


3. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs-data</copy>
    ```
    to create a mount point.

4. Mount the file system, enter command:

    ```
    <copy>bash</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>sudo mount 10.x.x.x:/&lt;EXPORT_PATH_NAME> /mnt/nfs-data</copy>
    ```
    > **Note:** The 10.x.x.x should be replaced with the IP of File System Storage. EXPORT\_PATH\_NAME should be replaced with Export path name used earlier. (Example: If 10.0.0.3 is the IP of File System Storage, and '/' is the EXPORT\_PATH\_NAME, then **sudo mount 10.0.0.3:/ /mnt/nfs-data**).

5. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>df -h</copy>
    ```
    and
    ```
    <copy>mount | grep /mnt/nfs-data</copy>
    ```
    and verify the mounted File System Storage.

    > **Note:** You may need to change `nfs-data` to the mount point directory you just created.

     ![](images/fss-007.png " ")

     ![](images/fss-008.png " ")

6. Go to your VCN instance, click **Security Lists** and then **Default Security List for YOUR\_VCN\_NAME**. If you do NOT see any Ingress Rule with *ICMP* as IP Protocal and want to ping the mount point, then you can add an Ingress Rule:

      - Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
      - IP Protocol: ICMP
      - Leave other fields blank

    > **Note:** If you already had one or multiple ICMP Ingress Rules, you can skip this step.

7. **Optional:** Second compute instance can be created and have the same file system mounted on it, following Step 3 and Step 4.

You have now mounted Enterprise grade File System Storage created in OCI to your compute instance. You can place files in this file system. All other VM instances that have mounted this file system will have access to it.

## Task 5: Delete the Resources
