# Introduction to Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) and Terraform

## Introduction

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Resource Manager is an Oracle-managed service that automates deployment and operations for all Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Unlike Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) offerings from other cloud vendors, the service is based on Terraform, a widely used, open source industry standard that allows DevOps engineers to develop and deploy their infrastructure anywhere. **Source:** [Oracle Resource Manager](https://www.oracle.com/devops/resource-manager/)

Please take a couple minutes to watch the following Introduction to Resource Manager.

### Prerequisites

-   Access to an OCI tenancy, preferably a new, clean Free Trial.
	-  If you require an Oracle Cloud Free Trial, please refer to the **Get Started** section above
-	Compartment **CareClinics**
	-  Any compartmemt will work.  To match the instructions below, create a new compartment with the name **CareClinics**
-	SSH Public/Private Key Pair
	-  Please see the instructions in Lab 1 for details on how to generate a SSH Public/Private Key Pair
-   Access to a text editor and compression software (7-zip, winzip, etc.)

## Task 1: Sign in to the Cloud and Create a Compartment

1. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud from <https://www.oracle.com> , click on **View Accounts** then **Sign in to Cloud**

	![Sign in to Cloud](./images/task1/sign-into-cloud.png " ")

5. You are now on the **Get Started** page of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console

	![OCI Console](./images/task1/cloud-console.png " ")

6. Compartments are the primary means to organize, segregate, and manage access to OCI resources.  Every tenancy has a root compartment under which you create additional sub-compartments and sub-sub compartments (maximum six levels deep).  Compartments are tenancy-wide across regions. When you create a compartment, it is available in every region that your tenancy is subscribed to. You can get a cross-region view of your resources in a specific compartment with the tenancy explorer. See [Viewing All Resources in a Compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/compartmentexplorer.htm#Viewing_All_Resources_in_a_Compartment).  We will create a compartment called **CareClinics** for this course/workshop and create all related services in this compartment.  Navigate to the menu in the upper left and select **Identity & Security** then **Compartments**.

8. This time we will create AND apply the ORM Stack at the same time. To do this, enable the **Run Apply** option and click **Create**.

	![Create and Apply Stack](./images/task4/create-apply-stack.png " ")

9. The Resource Manager Apply job is now executing, the status will go from **ACCEPTED** to **IN PROGRESS** to **SUCCEEEDED**.

	![Stack Apply Succeeded](./images/task4/stack-apply-succeeded.png " ")

10. Examining the **Logs**, you will see **1** resource was added

	![Stack Apply Logs](./images/task4/stack-apply-logs.png " ")

11. Examining the **Job Resources**, you can see the **Attribute** details for **testCompute** by clicking **Show**. Here you will see the **Public** and **Private IP Addresses** assigned to the compute instance.

	![Stack Resources](./images/task4/stack-resources.png " ")

12. If you click on the Resource Name **testCompute**, this will open the **Instance details** page. Here you can see the all the details related to this compute instance.

	![Compute Instance Details](./images/task4/compute-instance-details.png " ")

13. Using the desired command prompt or the **Cloud Shell**, we can test the SSH connection to the newly compute instance by issuing the below command. You will use the private key **cloudshellkey** you created earlier along with **Public IP address** and the user **opc**

    ```
    <copy>
	ssh -i cloudshellkey opc@{compute_public_ip_address}
	</copy>
    ```

	![SSH Into Compute Instance](./images/task4/ssh-into-instance.png " ")

	![SSH Using Cloud Shell](./images/task4/ssh-cloud-shell.png " ")

## Task 5: Create an ORM Stack using the Template Feature

1. Navigate to Resource Manager's Stacks page and click **Create Stack**. Be sure you are in the **CareClinics** Compartment.

	![Create Stack](./images/task5/create-stack.png " ")

2. On the **Create Stack** page, select **Template**, be sure the **CareClinics** compartment is selected, click on **Select Template** to select the desired OCI resource to create.

	![Select Template](./images/task5/select-template.png " ")

3. On the **Browse templates** pop-out, select the **Service** tab, **Compute Instance**, click the expand icon to read what will be deployed. Lastly, click the **Select Template** button to proceed.

	**Note:** You can also select **Quickstarts** and **Architecture** templates for deploying out-of-the-box OCI environments.

	![Select Compute Template](./images/task5/select-compute-template.png " ")

4. Scroll down and enter the Stack name **Compute Instance-Template.** Be sure you are in the **CareClinics** Compartment and click **Next**.

	![Stack Name](./images/task5/stack-name.png " ")

5. Enter the compute instance name **ComputeTemplate**, select the VCN **testVCN**, select the subnet **Default Subnet....US-ASHBURN-AD-1** under the **Required Configuration** section

	![Instance Display Name and Select Subnet](./images/task5/instance-name-subnet.png " ")

6. Scroll down and enable **Assign Public IP** and choose the SSH Key file **cloudshellkey.pub** under the **Optional Configuration** section and click **Next**.

	![Public IP and SSH Keys](./images/task5/public-ip-ssh-keys.png " ")

7. Click **Create** on the Review screen

	![Review and Create Stack](./images/task5/review-create-stack.png " ")

8. The ORM Stack is now created. Let's run a **Plan** and see what would be created if we were to Apply it. Click on the **Plan** button on top of the page, then click **Plan** on the pop-out.

	![Stack Plan](./images/task5/stack-plan.png " ")

9. The status of the plan job will change from **IN PROGRESS** to **SUCCEEDED**. Click on **Logs** and scroll to the bottom. You will notice, 3 items will be created, and **OCI Compute Instance**, **OCI Boot Volume** and **OCI Boot Volume Attachment**.

	![Stack Plan Succeeded](./images/task5/plan-succeeded.png " ")


10. At this point, if you were to **Apply** this ORM stack, it **MIGHT** fail since the **VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro** Compute Shapes can reside in different **Availability Domains (AD)** depending on the Cloud Tenant you are using.  This ORM Stack Template was written to leverage **AD1**. In **Task 6**, we will download the **Terraform Configuration** and edit it accordingly to allow the Availability Domain to be selected.

	```
	Error: Service error:NotAuthorizedOrNotFound. shape VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro not found. http status code: 404.
	```

	![Stack Apply](./images/task5/stack-apply.png " ")

## Task 6: Download an ORM Stack, Review and Enhance it

In this task, we will download the Terraform Configuration files from the ORM Stack created in the previous task, review and edit the files to allow the user the ability to select the desired Availability Domain.  Documentation can be referenced in section [Task 1b: Create Your Own Terraform Configuration](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/samplecomputeinstance.htm)

1. Navigate to Resource Manager's **Stacks** page and click on the stack **Compute Instance-Template**. Be sure you are in the **CareClinics** Compartment.

	![Select Stack](./images/task6/select-stack.png " ")

2. Click **Download** to download the Terraform Configuration (Scripts) to your local machine.

	![Download Terraform Configuration](./images/task6/download-terraform-configuration.png " ")

3. Once downloaded, locate the ZIP file, and extract it to your local file system. The ORM Stack file name should look similar to this one below. It will contain the following files.

	![Unzip File](./images/task6/unzip-file.png " ")

	* **main.tf** - Contains the Provider along with all OCI Resources that will be provisioned.
	* **outputs.tf** - Allows you to define what outputs are displayed in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. 
	* **schema.yaml** - Schema documents are recommended for Terraform configurations when using Resource Manager. Including a schema document allows you to extend pages in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. Facilitate variable entry in the Create Stack page by surfacing SSH key controls and by naming, grouping, dynamically prepopulating values, and more.
	* **variables.tf** - Define the variables you want to use when provisioning your resources. A best practice is to create a "variables" file in the configuration package that you upload.

	**Note:**  When editing the above text files, please be sure the **indentation** in your files match the screens shots below.

4. Edit **variables.tf** using your desired text editor and add the follow line.

	```
    <copy>
	variable "availability_domain_name" {}
	</copy>
    ```

	![Edit Variables](./images/task6/edit-variables.png " ")

5. Edit **schema.yaml** using your desired text editor under the **requiredConfig** section and add the following line

	```
    <copy>
	- availability_domain_name
	</copy>
    ```

	![Edit Schema Required Config](./images/task6/edit-schema-required.png " ")

6. Edit **schema.yaml** using your desired text editor under the **variables** section and add the following lines

	```
    <copy>
	availability_domain_name:
	  type: oci:identity:availabilitydomain:name
	  dependsOn:
	    compartmentId: compartment_ocid
	  required: true
	  title: ${Messages.solutionsHub.genericVariables.availability_domain_name.title()}
	  description: ${Messages.solutionsHub.genericVariables.availability_domain_name.description()}
	</copy>
    ```

	![Edit Schema Variables](./images/task6/edit-schema-variables.png " ")

7. Edit **main.tf** using your desired text editor under the **variables** section and add the following line **AND** comment out the existing **availability_domain** line.

	```
    <copy>
	availability_domain = var.availability_domain_name
	</copy>
	```
	
	![Edit Main](./images/task6/edit-main.png " ")

8. Create a new ZIP file with the name **Compute-Instance-Template-New.zip**. Make sure it contains the following files. Some of which you just updated.

	![Create New Zip](./images/task6/create-new-zip.png " ")

9. Create a new ORM Stack from the file **Compute-Instance-Template-New.zip**. Click on the **Create Stack**. Be sure you are in the **CareClinics** Compartment.

	![Create New Stack](./images/task6/create-new-stack.png " ")

10. Select **My configuration**, select **.Zip file** and drag/drop the file **Compute-Instance-Template-New.zip.** Also, scroll down and enter the Stack Name of **Compute-Instance-Template-New** and verify the Compartment is **CareClinics** and click **Next**

	![Stack Type and Config](./images/task6/stack-type-config.png " ")

	![Stack Name](./images/task6/stack-name.png " ")

11. Enter the name **Compute-Template**, select the **-AD-1** or **AD-3** Availability Domain, select the **testVCN** and select the Subnet **Default Subnet....US-ASHBURN-AD-1**.

	**Note:** The **[Always-Free](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm)** shape **VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro** is available in only one Availabilty Domain (**-AD-1**, **-AD-2**,**-AD-3** ) and can be different by tenant.  You can navaigate to **Governance & Administration** -> **Limits, Quotas and Usage** to see which Availabilty Domain they reside in.

	![Availability Domain and VCN](./images/task6/ad-vcn.png " ")

12. Select **Assign Public IP**, drag/drop the SSH Public Key **cloudshellkey.pub** and click **Next**

	![Assign Public IP and SSH Key](./images/task6/ip-sshkey.png " ")

13. Click **Create**

	![Create Stack](./images/task6/create-stack.png " ")

14. Click **Plan**, then **Plan**

	![Stack Plan](./images/task6/stack-plan.png " ")

15. After a **SUCCEEDED** Plan, Click **Stack Details**

	![Stack Succeeded](./images/task6/stack-succeeded.png " ")

16. Click **Apply**, then **Apply**

	![Stack Apply](./images/task6/stack-apply.png " ")

17. Once the **Apply** Job has **SUCCEEDED**, click on **Outputs**, here you can see the **public** and **private** **IP Address** of the Compute Instance that was just provisioned.

	![Stack Succeeded and Outputs](./images/task6/stack-succeeded-outputs.png " ")

18. You can also click on **Job resources** and see the 3 Cloud Services provisioned by this ORM Stack. Click on **Compute-Template**.

	![Stack Job Resources](./images/task6/stack-job-resources.png " ")

19. You are now in the **Compute->Instances->Instance details** page. Here you can also see details such as **Public IP Address, VCN, Availability Domain**, etc.

	![Compute Instance Detials](./images/task6/instance-details.png " ")

## Task 7: Advanced Feature remote-exec

With Resource Manager, you can use Terraform's remote exec functionality to execute scripts or commands on a remote computer. You can also use this technique for other provisioners that require access to the remote resource.  More information can be found at [Using Remote Exec Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/usingremoteexec.htm).

1. Using a text editor, lets create the following Terraform Configuration files

	- **remote-exec.tf**	- This will contain the Terraform resource **remote-exec**
	- **variables.tf**		- This will contain the required variables
	- **schema.yaml** 		- This file facilitates variable entry when creating and editing ORM Stacks

	**Note:**  When creating the above text files, please be sure the **indentation** in your files match the screens shots below.

2. Create the **variables.tf** file

	```
    <copy>
	provider "oci" {}
	variable "host_public_ip" {}
	variable "ssh_private_key" {}
	</copy>
	```

	![Create Variables File](./images/task7/create-variables.png " ")

3. Create the **remote-exec.tf** file

	**Note:**  Here you will notice the **inline** command **touch** is executed after connecting to the Compute Instance's **public IP address** as user **OPC** with a **private SSH key**.

	```
    <copy>
	resource "null_resource" "remote-exec" {
	  provisioner "remote-exec" {
		connection {
		  agent       = false
		  timeout     = "30m"
		  host        = "${var.host_public_ip}"
		  user        = "opc"
		  private_key = "${var.ssh_private_key}"
		}
	  
		inline = [
		  "touch ~/IMadeAFile.Right.Here"
		]
	  } 
	}
	</copy>
    ```

	![Create Remote Exec File](./images/task7/create-remote-exec.png " ")

4. Create the **schema.yaml** file

	```
    <copy>
	# remote-exec schema yaml file
	  title: "Update a Compute instance using remote-exec"
	  stackDescription: ${Messages.solutionsHub.solutions.computeInstance.stackDescription()}
	  schemaVersion: 1.1.0
	  version: "20200301"
	  locale: "en"

	  variableGroups:  
	  - title: ${Messages.solutionsHub.requiredConfig()}
		visible: true  
		variables:
		- host_public_ip
		- ssh_private_key

	  variables:
		host_public_ip:
		  type: string
		  required: true
		  title: "Enter Compute IP Address"
		  description: "Enter the Public IP Address of the Compute Instance from Task 6"
		ssh_private_key:
		  type: text
		  multiline: true
		  required: true
		  title: "Enter a Private Key"
		  description: "Enter the value from the cloudshellkey file"
	</copy>
    ```

	![Create Schema File](./images/task7/create-schema.png " ")

5. Zip the three files you just created into a file called **remote-exec.zip**.

	![Create Zip File](./images/task7/create-zip.png " ")

6. Navigate to Resource Manager's Stacks page and click **Create Stack**. Be sure you are in the **CareClinics** Compartment.

	![Create Stack](./images/task7/create-stack.png " ")

7. On the **Create Stack** page, select **My Configuration**, select **.Zip file,** drag/drop the file **remote-exec.zip**, accept all the other default values and click **Next.**

	![Select Type and File](./images/task7/select-type-file.png " ")

8. Enter the Compute Instance **Public IP Address** from Task 6. Also enter the SSH Private Key from the file **cloudshellkey** and click **Next**

	![Public IP and SSHKEY](./images/task7/ip-sshkey.png " ")

9. Click **Create**

	![Click Create](./images/task7/click-create.png " ")

10. Click **Plan** and **Plan**

	![Stack-Plan](./images/task7/stack-plan.png " ")


11. Click **Stack Details** then click **Apply** and **Apply**
	
	![Stack-Apply](./images/task7/stack-apply.png " ")

12. The status of the **Apply** will become **SUCCEEDED**

	![Apply Succeeded](./images/task7/apply-succeeded.png " ")

13. You will see in the **Logs**, Terraform connected to the Compute Instance and completed the **Inline** command.

	![Stack Logs](./images/task7/stack-logs.png " ")

14. If you SSH into the compute Instance using a local command shell or Cloud Shell, you will see the file **IMadeAFile.Right.Here** was created successfully.

	![SSH Verify File](./images/task7/verify-file-created.png " ")

	![Cloud Shell Verify File](./images/task7/verify-file-cloud-shell.png " ")

## Task 8: Destroy all OCI Resources

1. We will now leverage the **Destroy** functionality in Terraform to delete the OCI Services provisioned earlier.

	**Note:** Executing a **Destroy** does NOT delete the ORM Stack (Terraform Configuration Files), but rather will delete the OCI Services provisioned during the **Plan** jobs. The ORM Stacks can be leveraged again to provision the same OCI services at a future time.

2. Navigate to Resource Manager's Stacks page. Be sure you are in the **CareClinics** Compartment. We created OCI Services in 3 ORM Stacks which are highlighted in Red below. Click on the Stack **Compute-Instance-Template-New**.

	![Select Stack](./images/task8/select-stack.png " ")

3. Click on **Destroy**, then **Destroy** in the pop-out.

	![Destroy Template Stack](./images/task8/destroy-stack-templatenew.png " ")

4. If you navigate over to the Compute Instances Page quickly, you will see the instance is in a State of **Terminating**.

	![Destroy State](./images/task8/destroy-state.png " ")

5. Once the **Destroy** Job is **SUCCEEDED**, if you examine the **Logs**, you will see the 3 services originally created by this Stack are now deleted.

	![Destroy Succeeded](./images/task8/destroy-succeeded.png " ")

	![Destroy Logs](./images/task8/destroy-logs.png " ")

6. Let's repeat this process for Stack **Compute-Terraform**. Click on **Destroy**, then **Destroy** in the pop-out.

	![Destroy Quick Start Compute](./images/task8/destroy-stack-computeqs.png " ")

7. Once the **Destroy** job is **SUCCEEDED**, you will see the Compute Instance has a state of **Terminated**.

	![Destroy Succeeded](./images/task8/destroy-succeeded2.png " ")

8. Let's repeat this process for Stack **VCN-Terraform**. Click on **Destroy**, then **Destroy** in the pop-out.

	![Destroy Quick Start VCN](./images/task8/destroy-stack-vcnqs.png " ")

9. Once **SUCCEEDED**, you can examine the **Logs** and see the 6 resources created by the stack have been destroyed.

	![Destroy Succeeded and Logs](./images/task8/destroy-succeeded-logs.png " ")
