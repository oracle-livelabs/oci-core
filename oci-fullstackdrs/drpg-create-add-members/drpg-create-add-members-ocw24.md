# Create DR Protection groups and add members

## Introduction

In this lab, we will Create and Associate Disaster Recovery Protection Groups (DRPG), Add required members in Primary and Standby DR protection groups. Ashburn is the primary region and Phoenix is the standby region.

**DR Protection group (DRPG)** â€“ A resource type used by Full Stack DR.  A DR Protection Group represents a consistency grouping defined for the purposes of disaster recovery.  It is a collection of different OCI resources that comprise an application and must be treated as a combined group when performing disaster recovery operations.  For example, a DR Protection Group may consist of application servers (compute instances), associated block storage (grouped as volume groups), and databases.

**Members**- A resource type which can be added to a DRPG. Full Stack DR currently supports all the below member types. These resources can be added as member to a DRPG.

- Compute Instances ( Moving and Non-moving)
- Boot and Block Volumes (Volume Groups)
- Oracle Exadata Database Service
- Oracle Base Database Service
- Oracle Autonomous Database on Shared Exadata Infrastructure (Serverless)
- Load Balancer
- File Storage Service

Estimated Time: 25 Minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

- Create DRPG in Ashburn and Phoenix regions.
- Associate Ashburn DRPG as primary and Phoenix DRPG as Standby
- Add members to Ashburn DRPG (Primary) - ATP(Primary DB),MuShop Compute VM's(node-0 and node-1),two volume groups( Boot volumes of MuShop Compute VM's),Load Balancer
- Add members to Phoenix DRPG (Standby)- ATP(Standby DB),Load Balancer

**As part of the MuShop architecture, virtual machines are deployed using either the Cold VM or Pilot Light pattern. During the DR plan execution, Full Stack DR will create the MuShop VMs in the Phoenix region.**

## Task 1: Create DRPG in Ashburn and Phoenix regions

1.  Login into OCI Console with your provided Credentials. The primary region should be **Ashburn**.

    ![Ashburn OCI Console](./images/ashburn-region-new.png)

    Open another browser tab and then select region as **Phoenix** (Standby Region)

    ![Phoenix OCI Console](./images/phoenix-region-new.png)

2.  In the first browser tab,Select **Migration and Disaster Recovery** from the Hamburger menu, then **Disaster Recovery** -> **DR Protection Groups**. Verify the region is **Ashburn**

    ![DRPG from ashburn](./images/ashburn-drpgpage-new.png)

3.  In the second browser tab,Select **Migration and Disaster Recovery** from the Hamburger menu, then **Disaster Recovery** -> **DR Protection Groups** Verify the region is **Phoenix**

    ![DRPG from phoenix](./images/phoenix-drpgpage-new.png)

4.  You will land up at the Disaster Recovery Protection group home page; make sure to have two tabs opened for Ashburn and Phoenix region.Make sure to select the right compartment.

    ![DRPG landing page for IAD](./images/ashburn-drpg-new.png)
    ![DRPG landing page for PHX](./images/phoenix-drpg-new.png)

5.  Create DRPG in the Ashburn region. Select **Create DR Protection group** in the Ashburn region browser tab and follow the below instructions.

    - Enter name as **mushop-ashburn**
    - Select the compartment assigned to you
    - In the object storage bucket, use the drop-down option and select **mushop-xxxxx** (mushop-12345)  ( Don't select mushop-media-xxxxx bucket)
    - In role, leave it as **Not Configured**
    - Ignore add member
    - Verify and hit create

    ![create drpg](./images/ashburn-drpgcreate-new.png)

    Navigate back to the DR Protection group page and refresh; the state of DRPG will change from creating to active in a few seconds.

    ![drpg status](./images/ashburn-drpgactive-new.png)

6.  Create DRPG in the Phoenix region. Select **Create DR Protection group** in the Phoenix region browser tab and follow the below instructions.

    - Enter name as **mushop-phoenix**
    - Select the compartment assigned to you
    - In the object storage bucket, use the drop-down option and select **mushop-xxxxx** (mushop-12345) ( Don't select mushop-media-xxxxx bucket)

7.  Now, we have added all the required members in the **mushop-phoenix** DRPG. It should ADB (Standby) Database and a Load Balancer. DRPG status will show as active.

    ![drpg members phoenix](./images/phoenix-allmembers-new1.png)

    You may now [Proceed to the next lab](#next)

## Troubleshooting tips

1. After adding the member, in case if the member is not showing up. Re-add the member again.
