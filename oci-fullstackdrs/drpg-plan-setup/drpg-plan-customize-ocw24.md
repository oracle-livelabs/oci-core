# Create DR plans and customize Failover plan

## Introduction

In this lab, we will focus on how to create switchover, failover, and start drill plans. We will also customize the failover plan according to MuShop application requirements. The Full Stack DR service does not allow the creation of DR plans in the DRPG with a **Primary** role (Ashburn). All DR plans must be created in the DRPG with a **standby** role (Phoenix). 

**DR Plans**- A DR Plan represents a DR workflow associated with a pair of DR Protection Groups. A DR Plan is represented as a sequence of Plan Groups. These Plan Groups in turn consist of Plan Steps. A DR Plan can only be created at the Standby DR Protection Group.

There are four types of DR plans which you can create in Full Stack DR.

- Switchover Plan:Used for planned and controlled transition of services from a primary to a standby region. It involves shutting down services in the primary region and bringing them up in the standby region. 
- Failover Plan: Used for unplanned recovery during disasters or outages. It immediately activates services in the standby region whenever the primary is entirely inaccessible.
- Drill Plans: Performing DR drills is an essential DR service capability that allows users to exercise and validate their business continuity configuration and plans without disrupting their production stack.
    - Start Drill: It creates a replica of your production stack without impacting production.Perform a complete dry run of a failover for validation
    - Stop Drill: Removes the replica of your production stack created earlier by Start drill.
 
**Plan Group** – A group of steps in a DR Plan. A DR Plan consists of one or more Plan Groups that execute sequentially. All steps in a Plan Group execute in parallel. 

There are two types of plan groups

- Built-In Groups or Steps – A type of Plan Group or Step that is generated automatically by FSDR when a DR Plan is created. Examples of Built-in Plan Steps are: Launch Compute Instance, Switchover Database, etc.

- User-Defined Groups or Steps– A type of Plan Group or Step that is added by the user to a DR Plan after the DR plan is created by FSDR. 

Estimated Time: 20 Minutes

    - Click **Add**

    ![Add restoreapp steps](./images/phoenix-restoreapp-bothsteps-new.png)

    **mushop-phoenix** DRPG will go into updating state, and after a few seconds, it will return to the active state. Refresh the DRPG page if required. You should be able to see that the *Restore Application* Plan group is created successfully with both steps. **Restore Application** plan group will be added after **Restore Database Wallet** plan group.

    ![added restoreapp plangroup](./images/phoenix-restoreapp-addedpg-new.png)
 
## Task 4: Verify the Failover plan and plan groups

1.  We have created all the required (two) user-defined groups in the **mushop-app-failover-iad-phx** failover plan as part of the Mushop application failover.

    ![review all userdefined groups](./images/phoenix-userdef-groups-new.png)

2.  Let's review the **mushop-app-failover-iad-ph** failover plan 

    -  Prechecks-Built in - These are the built-in prechecks groups for all the Plan groups (Built-in and User defined).
    -  Based on the members we have added in both Primary DRPG and Standby DRPG, Full Stack DR created **four** Built-in plan groups for the failover plan.
    -  We have manually created **two** user-defined groups as per the Mushop application failover requirements.
    -  In summary, the **mushop-app-failover-iad-phx** failover plan has created with *one*- Built-in prechecks plan group, *four*- Built-in Plan groups,*two*- User defined Plan groups

    ![all groups in DR plan](./images/phoenix-all-plangroups-new.png)

3.  Plan groups can be reordered as per the failover workflow requirement.Since we have created the user defined plan groups in correct order, there is no need to reorder the user defined plan groups.
