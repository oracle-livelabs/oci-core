# Create and Customize the DR Switchover Plan

## Introduction

In this lab, we will create a DR Switchover plan and customize the plan with additional steps. Ashburn is a primary region, and Phoenix is the standby region. Full Stack DR provides two types of plan

- Switchover (Maintenance/Planned Disaster Recovery)
- Failover   (Actual Disaster Recovery/Unplanned)

This lab will focus on how to create a Switchover plan and customize the plan as per MuShop application requirements. DR Plan *must* be created in the standby region (Phoenix). It is because, in the case of the worst-case scenario, the entire primary region outside the Full Stack DR will not be accessible from the primary region.

Estimated Time: 20 Minutes

### Objectives

- Create a Switchover plan
- Gather Load Balancer OCID's
- Customize the Switchover plan- Remove Primary Load Balancer Backends group
- Customize the Switchover plan- Restore Database Wallet group
- Customize the Switchover plan- Restore the Application Group
- Customize the Switchover plan- Add Standby Load Balancer Backends group
- Review the Switchover plan- Reorder groups

## Task 1: Create a Switchover plan

1.  Login into OCI Console with your provided Credentials. Select region as **Phoenix**.

    ![phoenix region](./images/phoenix-region-new.png)

2.  Select Migration and Disaster Recovery from the Hamburger menu, then **Disaster Recovery** -> **DR Protection Groups**. Verify the region is **Phoenix**

    ![phoenix region drpg](./images/phoenix-drpgpage-new.png)

3.  You will land on the Disaster Recovery Protection group home page; make sure you have selected the Phoenix region. **DR Plans always be created in the Standby DRPG (Phoenix region)**

    ![drpg home](./images/drpg-status-phoenix-new.png)

4. Select the **mushop-phoenix** DRPG and navigate to Plans under the resources section.

    ![drpg dr plan](./images/phoenix-drplan-new.png)

    - Create plan
    - Name as **mushop-app-switchover**
    - Plan type as **Switchover (planned)**
    - Hit Create

    ![drpg create plan](./images/phoenix-create-drplan-new.png)

    The plan will start creating; select the plan **mushop-app-switchover**.

    ![drpg creating plan](./images/phoenix-drplan-creating-new.png)

    Refresh the DR Plan page if required. You can monitor the request's status in the **Work requests** section under Resources. Within a minute, the plan will get created, and it should be in *active* State.

    ![drpg plan created](./images/phoenix-drplan-created-new.png)

    Select the **mushop-app-switchover** plan, and you should be able to various built-in plan groups.

    ![drpg plan details](./images/phoenix-drplan-details-new.png)

    Based on the members we added in both primary and standby DRPG, Full Stack DR created these built-in plans. You can navigate the plan groups to see the various steps created.

    ![drpg plan more details](./images/phoenix-drplan-moredetails-new.png)

    - Built-in Prechecks - These are prechecks for the app, DB, and volume group switchover
    - Stop Compute Instances (Primary) - Stop app virtual machines in the Ashburn region (primary)
    - Switchover Volume Group (Standby) - Switchover volume group in the phoenix region (standby)
    - Switchover Autonomous Databases (Standby) - Switchover ATP DB from Ashburn to Phoenix region
    - Launch Compute Instances (Standby) - Create virtual machines in the phoenix region (standby)
    - Remove Compute Instances From DR Protection Group (Primary)- Remove compute instances from the Ashburn(primary) DRPG
    - Terminate Compute Instances (Primary) - Terminate compute instances in the Ashburn region (primary). By default the plan group is disabled, it can be enabled depending on the requirements.
    - Reverse Volume Group Replication (Standby)- Set up reverse volume group replication from Phoenix to Ashburn region
    - Remove Volume Groups From DR Protection Group (Primary)-Remove volume group from the Ashburn(primary) DRPG
    - Terminate Volume Group (Primary)- Terminate volume groups in the Ashburn region (primary). By default the plan group is disabled, it can be enabled depending on the requirements.

## Task 2: Gather Load Balancer OCID's

1.  As a prerequisite, we need to gather OCIDs (Oracle Cloud Identifier) of load balancers running in the Ashburn (Primary) and Phoenix (Standby) region.

2.  Leave the existing DRPG console tabs as running. Now open two new OCI console tabs and ensure you are logged into the auburn region and phoenix region, respectively.

3.  From the Hamburger menu, select **Networking**, then **Load Balancers**. Make sure you are logged in to **Ashburn** region.
  
    ![ashburn loadbalancer home](./images/ashburn-loadbalancer-navigate-new.png)

4. You should have a load balancer with the name **mushop-xxxx**; choose the right compartment assigned to you. Select the three dots on the right end of the load balancer details. Select **Copy OCID** and paste the OCID details safely into any preferred notes. You should have something similar to below

    **ocid1.loadbalancer.oc1.iad.aaaaaaaa2t4kwwavlgwghuebrcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx** (**Don't use this**)

    ![ashburn loadbalancer OCID](./images/ashburn-lb-ocid-new.png)

5.  From the Hamburger menu, select **Networking**, then **Load Balancers**. Make sure you are logged in to **Phoenix** region.
  
    ![phonenix loadbalancer home](./images/phoenix-loadbalancer-navigate-new.png)

6.  You should have a load balancer with the name **mushop-xxxx**; choose the right compartment assigned to you. Select the three dots on the right end of the balancer details. Select **Copy OCID** and paste the OCID details safely into any preferred notes. You should have value something similar to below

    **ocid1.loadbalancer.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaaqo6sn6xku3vcuiqjbxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**  (**Don't use this**)

    ![phoenix loadbalancer OCID](./images/phoenix-lb-ocid-new.png)


## Task 3: Customize the Switchover plan-Remove Primary Load Balancer Backends group

1.  Use the browser tab where you have created the switchover plan in phoenix region. Create user-defined groups for mushop application switchover. We need to create four user-defined groups. Let's create those. You can do this by selecting **Add group** in the *mushop-app-switchover* plan

    ![add plan group](./images/phoenix-plangroup-add-new.png)

2.  Enter **Remove Primary Load Balancer Backends** in the Group name and Click **Add Step**

    ![added lbadd step](./images/phoenix-lbadd-added-new.png)

## Task 7: Verify and reorder the User defined groups

1.  We have created all the required (Four) user-defined groups in the **mushop-app-switchover** switchover plan as part of the Mushop application switchover.

    ![review all userdefined groups](./images/phoenix-userdef-groups-new.png)

2.  Let's review the **mushop-app-switchover** switchover plan 

    -  Built-in Precheck - These are the built-in prechecks groups for all the Plan groups (Built-in and User defined).
    -  Based on the members we have added in both Primary DRPG and Standby DRPG, Full Stack DR created nine Built-in switchover plan groups.
    -  We have manually created four user-defined groups per the Mushop application switchover requirement.
    -  In summary, the **mushop-app-switchover** switchover plan has created with *one*- Built-in precheck plan group, *nine*- Built-in Plan group,*four*- User defined Plan group

    ![all groups in DR plan](./images/phoenix-all-plangroups-new.png)

3.  Plan groups can be reordered as per the switchover workflow requirement. As part of the Mushop Switchover plan, we would like to execute **Remove Primary Load Balancer Backends** plan group after the **Built-In Prechecks** plan group. Use the **Actions** after the Add group, and select **Reorder groups**

    ![reorder dr plan group](./images/phoenix-reorder-groups-new.png)

4.  Go to the **Remove Primary Load Balancer Backends** plan group, use the move up **^** symbol, and keep moving up the **Remove Primary Load Balancer Backends** plan group and place it after the **Built-In Prechecks** plan group. This is very important to execute the plan groups in the proper order. Verify and hit **Save changes**. Don't move the other groups. 

    ![moving the plangroup](./images/phoenix-plangrp-moving-new.png)
    ![moved the plangroup](./images/phoenix-plangrp-moved-new.png) 

5.  You should be able to see **Remove Primary Load Balancer Backends** plan group moved after the **Built-In Prechecks** plan group.
