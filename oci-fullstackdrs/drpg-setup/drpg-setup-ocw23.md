# Create and Associate Disaster Recovery Protection Groups

## Introduction

In this lab, we will Create and Associate Disaster Recovery Protection Groups (DRPG). Ashburn is a primary region, and Phoenix is the standby region.

What is DRPG â€“ A resource type used by Full Stack DR.  A DR Protection Group represents a consistency grouping defined for the purposes of disaster recovery.  It is a collection of different OCI resources that comprise an application and must be treated as a combined group when performing disaster recovery operations.  For example, a DR Protection Group may consist of application servers (compute instances), associated block storage (grouped as volume groups), and databases.

Estimated Time: 5 Minutes

### Objectives

- Create DRPG in Ashburn and Phoenix regions.
- Associate Ashburn DRPG as primary and Phoenix DRPG as Standby

## Task 1: Create DRPG in Ashburn and Phoenix regions

1.  Login into OCI Console with your provided Credentials. The primary region should be **Ashburn**.

5.  Create DRPG in the Ashburn region. Select **Create DR Protection group** in the Ashburn region browser tab and follow the below instructions.

    - Enter name as **mushop-ashburn**
    - Select the compartment assigned to you
    - In the object storage bucket, use the drop-down option and select **mushop-xxxxx** (mushop-12345)  ( Don't select mushop-media-xxxxx bucket)
    - In role, leave it as **Not Configured**
    - Ignore add member
    - Verify and hit create

    ![create drpg](./images/ashburn-drpgcreate-new.png)

    Navigate back to the DR Protection group page and refresh; the state of DRPG will change from creating to active in a few seconds.

6.  Create DRPG in the Phoenix region. Select **Create DR Protection group** in the Phoenix region browser tab and follow the below instructions.

    - Enter name as **mushop-phoenix**
    - Select the compartment assigned to you
    - In the object storage bucket, use the drop-down option and select **mushop-xxxxx** (mushop-12345) ( Don't select mushop-media-xxxxx bucket)
    - In role, leave it as **Not Configured**
    - Ignore add member
    - Verify and hit create

    ![create drpg](./images/phoenix-drpgcreate-new.png)

    Navigate back to the DR Protection group page and refresh; the state of DRPG will change from creating to active in a few seconds.

    ![drpg status](./images/phoenix-drpgactive-new.png)

## Task 2: Associate Ashburn DRPG as primary and Phoenix DRPG as Standby

1. From the Ashburn region OCI console, select **mushop-Ashburn** DRPG. Select the **Associate** button

    ![drpg associate](./images/drpg-associate-new.png)

    - Select Role as **Primary**
    - Select Peer Region as **US West (Phoenix)**,
    - Select Peer DR Protection group in the compartment (change assigned compartment if required); you should select **mushop-phoenix**
    - Verify and associate

    ![drpg associate confirm](./images/drpg-associate-1-new.png)

    **mushop-ashburn** DRPG will change to *Updating* State

    ![drpg associate update](./images/drpg-associate-updating-new.png)

    Navigate back to the DR Protection group home page. You should be able to see DRPG **mushop-ashburn** state as *Active*, role as *Primary*, peer region as *US West (Phoenix)*

    ![drpg associate done](./images/drpg-status-ashburn-new.png)

2.  From the Phoenix region OCI console, navigate to the DR Protection group home page. You should be able to see DRPG **mushop-phoenix** state as *Active*, role as *Standby*, peer region as *US East (Ashburn)*

    ![drpg associate status](./images/drpg-status-phoenix-new.png)

    Now, we have associated **mushop-Ashburn** as *Primary DRPG* and **mushop-phoenix**  as *Standby DRPG*

    You may now [Proceed to the next lab](#next)
