# Perform pre-checks for the DR Switchover Plan and break the MuShop Application

## Introduction

In this lab, you will run **Prechecks** for the **mushop-app-switchover** plan that was created in the previous lab.The **Run Prechecks** action executes all the **built-in prechecks** in parallel. These checks help validate the environment and configuration before any changes are made. We will also create an **outage** to the Mushop application before executing the DR plan in the next lab.


> ⚠️ **Note:** Running prechecks does **not** initiate the actual switchover. It only performs *validation steps*.
> Successfully completing the prechecks is a **critical prerequisite** for executing the switchover plan.

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes

### Objectives

- Perform Run prechecks for the switchover plan
- Monitor the executed prechecks plan
- Verify the executed prechecks plan
- Verify the MuShop application and break the application

## Task 1: Perform Run prechecks for the Switchover plan

1.  Login into OCI Console with your provided Credentials. Select region as **Phoenix**.

    ![phoenix region](./images/phoenix-region-new.png)

2.  Open the **Hamburger menu (☰)** and select **Migration and Disaster Recovery**. Then go to **Disaster Recovery → DR Protection Groups** and Confirm that the **region is set to Phoenix**.

    ![phoenix region drpg](./images/phoenix-drpgpage-new.png)

3.  You will land on the Disaster Recovery Protection group home page; make sure you have selected the Phoenix region. **DR Plans always be created and executed in the Standby DRPG (Phoenix region)**

4.  Select the **mushop-phoenix-xxxxx** DRPG, navigate to the **Plans** tab, and select the **mushop-app-switchover** plan.

5.  Use the **Actions** button and click **Run prechecks**

    ![navigate drpg prechecks](./images/phoenix-run-prechecks-new.png)

6.  In the **Run prechecks** window, provide the Plan execution name as **mushop-app-switchover-prechecks** and hit **Run prechecks**

    ![drpg execute prechecks](./images/phoenix-execute-prechecks-new.png)

> **Note:** We have seen how to run prechecks for the **Switchover** plan. Similarly, you can run prechecks for the **Failover** and **StartDrill** plans created in the previous lab.

## Task 2: Monitor the executed prechecks plan

1.  Navigate to the **Plan Executions** section and select the **mushop-app-switchover-prechecks** plan execution. Then, go to the **Plan Execution Group** tab.Initially, you will see all the **Built-in Prechecks** listed with the status *Queued*.


    ![prechecks status](./images/phoenix-execute-queued-new.png)

2.  Refresh the page; within a few seconds, the **State** will change from *Queued* to *In Progress*.

    ![prechecks in-progress](./images/phoenix-execute-inprogress-new.png)

3.  All the **Built-in Prechecks** steps will execute in parallel. You can monitor the progress and view logs for each step individually.

    To do this, navigate to the **three dots (...)** next to the respective built-in step and click on it. You will see options to **View Log** and **Download Log**. These logs are stored in the **Object Storage bucket** that was provided during the DRPG creation. Downloading the logs can be helpful for **troubleshooting**, if needed.

## Task 3: Verify the executed prechecks plan

1. After 2–3 minutes, the **Built-in Prechecks** should complete successfully; verify each step's **status**, **duration**, and ensure all checks pass before proceeding.

    Refer to the **Troubleshooting tips** section for known failures and correction actions.


## Task 4: Verify the MuShop application and break the application

1.  Login into OCI Console with your provided Credentials. Select region as **Ashburn**.

    ![oci console ashburn](./images/ashburn-region-new.png)
  
2.  From the Hamburger menu, select **Networking**, then **Load Balancers**
  
    ![navigate loadbalancer](./images/ashburn-loadbalancer-navigate-new.png)

3.  Gather the Public IP address of the Load Balancer

     ![get loadbalancer IP](./images/ashburn-loadbalancer-ip-new.png)

4.  Verify the mushop application using `**http://ashburn loadbalancer ip**`
    replace with the actual value from Step 3. Navigate around the site and verify the cat products.

    ![mushop app](./images/mushop-app-new.png)

5.  Let us break the MuShop application to create an outage;click the **mushop-xxxxx** load balancer, then navigate to the **Listeners** section.

    ![load balancer landing page](./images/loadbalancer-ash-new.png)

    ![listeners load balancer](./images/loadbalancer-listeners-new.png)

6.  Select the **Edit** option by clicking the three dots (...) at the right end of the **mushop-xxxxx-80** listener on port 80.

    ![modify port 80](./images/port80-edit-new.png)

    Modify the listener port from 80 to 81 to break the application, and save changes. You will get work requests submitted and select close requests.

    ![modify port 80](./images/port80-edit1-new.png)
    ![modify port 81](./images/port81-edit-new.png)
    ![work request](./images/workrequest-listener-new.png)

    Wait for a few seconds and refresh the browser tab of the MuShop application. You should see that the MuShop site can't be reached or Error: Request failed with status code 502. 

    ![reverify mushop app](./images/mushop-broken-new.png)

    We have created an outage in the working MuShop application. In the next lab, we will use the **Full Stack DR** service to initiate a **Switchover** of the full stack (App VMs, Database, and Application Customizations) from the **Ashburn** region to the **Phoenix** region.

    You may now [Proceed to the next lab](#next)



## Troubleshooting tips

1.  During the pre-check execution logs, if you messages like "Requests are being throttled for instance ocid1", retry the **Run prechecks** again

    [ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.anuwcljt5h22avqcjswxs6tublhrz2qonyjmucpxlyjxplybldbpxz2jqkaq] -- Error returned by PutObject operation in ObjectStorage service.(409, Conflict, false) Server is busy. Requests are being throttled for instance ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.anuwcljt5h22avqcjswxs6tublhrz2qonyjmucpxlyjxplybldbpxz2jqkaq (opc-request-id: B7721980580148749787FE758C9440FC/3D8758622598943932D50842DCD7EAA1/143166BA790ECD35695B548600382010)

2. If there are errors related to the `ocarun` command, ensure that the required **dynamic groups** have been created and the appropriate **IAM policy** has been updated. For more details, refer [IAM Policy](https://blogs.oracle.com/maa/post/iam-policies-fullstackdr), section 5,6,7.
