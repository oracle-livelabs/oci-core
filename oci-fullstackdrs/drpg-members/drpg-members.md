# Add members to the DR Protection groups

## Introduction

In this lab, we will add members to the DR Protection groups created and associated in the previous lab. Ashburn is a primary region, and Phoenix is the standby region. This is an optional lab, in case if you want to destroy all the OCI resources.

**Members**- A resource type which can be added to a DRPG. Full Stack DR currently supports all the below member types. These resources can be added as member to a DRPG.

- Compute ( Standard Compute and Dedicated VM Host (DVH))
- Block Storage (Volume Groups)
- Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless (ADB-S)
- Oracle Autonomous Database on Dedicated Exadata Infrastructure (ADB-D)
- Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer (ADB-C@C)
- Oracle Base Database Service (BaseDB/DBCS)
- Oracle Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure (ExaDB-D/ExaCS)
- Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer (ExaCC)
- Oracle Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure (ExaDB-XS)
- Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer 
- File Storage Service
- Object Storage Bucket
- Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE)

Estimated Time: 15 Minutes

### Objectives

- Add members to Ashburn DRPG (Primary)- ATP(Primary DB),MuShop Compute VM's(node-0 and node-1),two volume groups( Boot volumes of MuShop Compute VM's), Load Balancer
- Add members to Phoenix DRPG (Standby)-ATP(Standby DB), Load Balancer

As part of the MuShop architecture,Virtual machines are deployed as Cold VM or Pilot light pattern.Full Stack DR will create the MuShop VM's in the phoenix region during the Switchover.

## Task 1: Add members to Ashburn DRPG (Primary)

1.  Login into OCI Console with your Credentials. The primary region should be **Ashburn**.

    ![Ashburn OCI Console](./images/ashburn-region-new.png)
    
2. Open the **Hamburger menu (â˜°)** and select **Migration and Disaster Recovery**. Then go to **Disaster Recovery â†’ DR Protection Groups** and Confirm that the **region is set to Ashburn**.

3.  You will land on the Disaster Recovery Protection group home page; make sure you have selected *the Ashburn* region.

    ![drpg landing page](./images/drpg-status-ashburn-new.png)

4. In the **Ashburn region**, open the **mushop-ashburn** DR Protection Group page.Add the following members:

    - **Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) Primary Database**
    - **Two mushop Compute VMs**
    - **Two Volume Groups** (for the boot volumes of the mushop Compute VMs)
    - **Load Balancer**

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Ensure each resource is added from the correct compartment and region.


5.  Add ATP Primary Database to DRPG.In the **Ashburn region**, open the **mushop-ashburn-xxxxx** DR Protection Group. Navigate to **Members** tab.

    Verify it and hit add. Make sure to check the box **"I understand that all existing plans will be deleted"**

    ![drpg add atp](./images/phoenix-atp-add-new.png)

    **mushop-phoenix** DRPG status will change to updating; wait for a few seconds. You should be able to see ATP database has been added as Member. Refresh the DRPG page if required. You can monitor the status in the *Work requests* section under Resources.

    ![drpg atp added](./images/phoenix-atp-added-new.png)

    Navigate back to the DR Protection group page; the status of DRPG should be active.

7. Add Load Balancer as member.

    It will show various resource types and select **Load Balancer**
    ![drpg resource type](./images/phoenix-resource-new-members.png)

    - Select Destination backend set **mushop-xxxxx**
    - Verify and add

    ![drpg add lbr](./images/phoenix-lbr-add-new.png)

    **phoenix-ashburn** DRPG status will change to updating; wait for a few seconds. You should see that the Load Balancer is added as a member. Refresh the DRPG page if required. You can monitor the request's status in the **Work requests** section under Resources.

    ![drpg lbr added](./images/phoenix-lbr-added-new.png)

    Navigate back to the DR Protection group page; the status of DRPG should be active. In case if you don't see the Load Balancer member, add it again.

8.  Now, we have added all the required members in the **mushop-phoenix** DRPG. It should show ATP Database and Load Balancer. DRPG status will show as active.

    ![drpg members phoenix](./images/phoenix-allmembers-new1.png)

    You may now [Proceed to the next lab](#next)

## Troubleshooting tips

1. After adding the member, in case if the member is not showing up. Re-add the member again.
