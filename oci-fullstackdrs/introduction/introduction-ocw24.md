# Introduction

## About the Workshop

In this workshop, we will use OCI Full Stack DR to create various DR plans (Switchover, Failover, Start Drill) and execute a failover plan for a cloud-native application (MuShop) deployed in OCI across two OCI regions. 

MuShop is a demo application designed to showcase various interoperable cloud services on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. It is an e-commerce website offering a variety of cat products and is a 3-tier web application.

For more details you can refer [MuShop Application](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cloudnative/tree/master/deploy/basic).

## Overview of OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery and the workshop 

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Full Stack Disaster Recovery orchestrates the transition of compute, database, and applications between OCI regions from around the globe with a single click. Customers can automate the steps needed to recover one or more business systems without redesigning or re-architecting existing infrastructure, databases, or applications and without needing specialized management or conversion servers.Throughout this workshop, we will use Full Stack DR to denote OCI Full Stack Disaster recovery.

- Full Stack DR assures comprehensive business continuity from a variety of data center outages. Using Disaster Recovery Service for disaster recovery ensures that organizations are minimally impacted if there is a region-wide outage or Availability Domain outage.

- Full Stack DR provides fully automated, end-to-end disaster recovery for the entire Oracle stack, including infrastructure, databases, engineered systems, virtual infrastructure, storage, and full-stack applications in OCI. It integrates with underlying replication mechanisms that synchronize primary and standby environments and protects mission-critical data.

- Full Stack DR is flexible and integrates with various Oracle platforms and non-Oracle applications and infrastructure. It generates, runs, and monitors disaster recovery plans for services and applications deployed in your tenancy. Disaster recovery operations are at the service level, so there is no impact on running other services in your tenancy. You can customize the disaster recovery plans generated by Full Stack DR based on your specific needs.

Below are some of the critical functionalities of Full Stack Disaster Recovery Service

- Create and automate DR run books and make them more flexible.
- Manage DR operations (Switchover,Failover,DR Drills) using a single pane of glass.
- Provide comprehensive logs with error management and recovery.
- Perform pre-checks before the DR execution plan.
- Provide a framework to customize DR operations.

### Benefits of OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery

Full Stack Disaster Recovery provides multiple benefits in the area of business continuity.

- Provides comprehensive disaster protection for the entire Application( Oracle/Non-Oracle) stack, including databases, VMs, attached volumes, storage, and applications across different OCI regions.
- Minimizes Recovery Time Objectives (RTO).
- Automates disaster recovery operations.
- Eliminates the need for domain specialists and dedicated administrators for disaster recovery.
- Provides highly flexible and customized disaster recovery plans. You can integrate your custom automation into the DR workflow.
- Provides a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring disaster recovery readiness and launching DR workflows.
- Executes scalable and reliable complete stack switchover and failover operations with a button.
- Operates at the service level instead of requiring the customer to manually failover VMs, databases, middleware, applications, storage, load balancers and Container Engine for Kubernetes(OKE)

### Estimated Workshop Time

**120 minutes** 

### Workshop Architecture

### Environment details

- **Ashburn** is the Primary region, and **Phoenix** is the Standby region.
- Pre-requisites for using Full Stack DR is to create various infrastructure resources and configure replication
- For this lab, LiveLabs provisions various resources like Autonomous DB (Primary and Standby),Compute instances,Setup block volume replication,Load Balancers, Object storage etc as per the workshop Architecture diagram shown above.

### Workshop Objectives

- Prepare the environments in Ashburn (Primary) for using the Full Stack DR.
- Create DR Protection groups (DRPG) in Ashburn (Primary) and Phoenix (Standby) regions.
- Associate Ashburn DRPG as Primary and Phoenix DRPG as Standby.
- Add members to Ashburn DRPG: Application Virtual Machines, Volume Groups, Primary ATP Database, Load Balancer.
- Add members to Phoenix DRPG: Standby ATP Database, Load Balancer.
- Create and customize DR plans (Switchover, Failover, Start Drill) in Phoenix (Standby) DRPG.
- Run DR Failover Pre-checks in Phoenix (Standby) DRPG.
- Verify and create an outage for the MuShop application from the Ashburn (Primary) region.
- Run the DR Failover Plan in Phoenix (Standby) DRPG.
- Verify the MuShop application from the Phoenix (New Primary) region.
