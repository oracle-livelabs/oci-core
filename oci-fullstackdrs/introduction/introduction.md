# Protect your business using Oracle Full Stack Disaster Recovery Service

## **OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery Service**

Oracle Full Stack Disaster Recovery Service is an OCI native and full managed Service. It provides full-stack disaster recovery orchestration for Oracle applications, Oracle Database,Compute Instance,Storage, networking, across **OCI regions**.

Throughout this workshop we will use FSDRS to denote Full Stack Disaster recovery Service.

FSDRS assures comprehensive business continuity from a variety of data center outages. Using Disaster Recovery Service for disaster recovery ensures that organizations are minimally impacted if there is a region-wide outage or Availability Domain outage.

FSDRS provides fully automated, end-to-end, disaster recovery for the entire Oracle stack including infrastructure, databases, engineered systems, virtual infrastructure, storage, and full-stack applications in OCI. It integrates with underlying replication mechanisms that synchronize primary and standby environments and protects mission critical data.

FSDRS is flexible and easily integrates with various Oracle platforms and non-Oracle applications and infrastructure. It generates, runs, and monitors disaster recovery plans for services and applications deployed in your tenancy. Disaster recovery operations are at the service level, so there is no impact on the running of other services in your tenancy. Based on your specific needs, you can customize the disaster recovery plans generated by Disaster Recovery Service.

While monitoring the progress of disaster recovery operations, you can take appropriate actions if there is an error in executing one or more steps. You can perform a periodic assessment of business continuity solutions using prechecks. This helps in assessing compliance and Disaster Recovery (DR) readiness.

Below are some of the key functionalities of Full Stack Disaster Recovery Service 

    Create and automate DR run books and make them more flexible.
    Manage DR operations using a single pane of glass.
    Provide comprehensive logs with error management and recovery.
    Perform pre-checks before the DR execution plan.
    Provide a framework to customize DR operations.


## Benefits of OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery Service

Disaster Recovery Service provides multiple benefits in the area of business continuity.

    Integrates with Active Data Guard and Data Guard APIs in the various database services (DBCS, ExaCS, ExaCC, and ADB).
    Provides comprehensive disaster protection for your entire Oracle stack that includes databases, VMs, attached volumes, storage, and applications across different OCI regions.
    Minimizes Recovery Time Objectives (RTO).
    Automates disaster recovery operations.
    Eliminates the need for domain specialists and dedicated administrators for disaster recovery.
    Provides highly flexible and customized disaster recovery plans. You can integrate your own custom automation into the DR workflow.
    Provides a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring disaster recovery readiness and for launching DR workflows.
    Executes scalable and reliable full stack switchover and failover operations with the push of a button.
    Operates at the service level instead of requiring the customer to manually failover VMs, databases, middleware, applications, storage and load balancers.

## About the Workshop

In this workshop we will see how easily you can automate the Full Stack Disaster Recovery orchestration like Switchover or Failover operations for a Cloud-native Application deployed in OCI across two regions using OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery Service (FSDRS). We will be using Mushop application and its underlying resources for performing the Switchover operations across regions. 

MuShop is a microservices demo application purpose-built to showcase interoperable Cloud Native services on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and to demonstrate a number of cloud native methodologies.The premise of MuShop is an e-commerce website offering a variety of cat products. It represents a polyglot microservices application, with actual use case scenarios for many Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.

Each microservice in MuShop is designed to highlight its own, or common high-level subject in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, using the context of the overall demo application.

### Environment details:

- Two VM's dbserver and wlsdr will be created
- As per the architecture diagram dbserver is designated as Primary Site and wlsdr is designated as Disaster Recovery site
- dbserver has Oracle Enterprise manager 13.5 (Site Guard),Oracle Database 19c with Data guard ( Primary DB), Oracle Weblogic 12c  (Application)
- wlsdr has Oracle Database 19c with Dataguard ( Standby DB), Oracle Weblogic 12c(Application)
- Various Site Guard configurations such as creating sites, credentials, plans are already pre-created. For additional information how to do that you can refer the Site guard documentation in the reference links section.


### Workshop Objectives:

- By using Start operation type in Site Guard to start Weblogic application in dbserver
- By using Switchover operation type in Site Guard to switchover Full Stack of Weblogic App and Database from dbserver to wlsdr
- By using Switchover operation type in Site Guard  to switchover Full Stack of Weblogic App and Database from wlsdr to dbserver
- By using Stop operation type in Site Guard to stop Weblogic application in dbserver
