### OCI Compute Service

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute lets you provision and manage compute hosts, known as instances. You can launch instances as needed to meet your compute and application requirements. After you launch an instance, you can access it securely from your computer, restart it, attach and detach volumes, and terminate it when you're done with it. The purpose of this lab is to give you an overview of how to set up a virtual machine instance and connect to the instance.
